# Flipadelphia Strategy Analysis

## Facts
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Trades | 2,928 (14 days) |
| Volume | $1.93M |
| Est. P&L | **-$869K** (-45%) |
| Buy Ratio | 70% |
| Trades/Day | 212 |
| Open Positions | $690K |

**Category Concentration**: 73% Iran geopolitics, rest sports

## Patterns
- **Heavy "No" betting on Iran events** - US strikes, Khamenei removal
- Buying at 0.88-0.99 prices (high confidence events won't happen)
- 894 both-sides trades on Iran = rolling positions across expiries
- Automated execution (clustered timestamps)
- Side sports betting (NHL, NFL, CBB)

## Hypothesis
**Directional Geopolitical Thesis Betting**

Betting heavily that US will NOT strike Iran. Rolling "No" positions across multiple expiry dates (Jan 26 → Feb 1 → Feb 28 → March 31).

## Evidence
- All top outcomes betting AGAINST imminent events
- $191K on single "Khamenei out by March - No"
- Multiple expiry dates = roll-forward strategy
- Massive concentration in one thesis

## Conclusion
| | |
|-|-|
| **Strategy** | Geopolitical thesis betting (anti-Iran-strike) |
| **Confidence** | High (80%) |
| **Edge Source** | Analytical conviction market overestimates strike probability |
| **Replicability** | Medium - requires strong geopolitical conviction |

## Risk Warning
-45% return with $690K still open. If US strikes Iran, catastrophic loss. The bio "never stress" is either ironic or extreme conviction.
