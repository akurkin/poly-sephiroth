        "description": "This is a market on if presidential candidate Joe Biden will test positive for COVID-19 before November 3rd, 2020. This will be defined as Joe publicly announcing - via any medium, including social media - that he has tested positive for COVID-19, or some variation of that statement. If it is in reference to antibodies, or he doesn’t publicly acknowledge it, the market will resolve to No.\nIn the event of ambiguity in terms of the market outcome, the market will be resolved at the sole discretion of the Markets Integrity Committee (MIC).",
