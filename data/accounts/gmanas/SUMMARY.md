- **95.6% buys**: Directional, not market-making
- **Both-sides on 14 events**: Live-betting with changing views

- **Multi-sport coverage**: Broad model or syndicate

## Hypothesis
**Live Sports Prediction Model / Syndicate**

Taking directional bets using external odds feeds or live game modeling. Both-sides trading = view changes mid-game. Late 0.999 buys = momentum/arb post-result.
